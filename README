AKKA-AMQP

A forked project from https://github.com/momania/akka-amqp

No logic changes are done on this fork.
All code changes involve reformatting, and cleaning up <- and => characters.

There were some configuration changes to get the project to compile and package.

Note that some tests still fail. This fork does not resolve those issues.
However, for performing basic AMQP functions, this build does work quite well.

You need to be using SBT 0.11.2 as 0.11.3 does not work with this Build.scala configuration.

To build your own jar 
sbt-0.11.2 package
