AKKA-AMQP

A forked project from https://github.com/momania/akka-amqp
Some configuration and testing tricks applied from https://github.com/kaesler/akka-amqp

Works with
"com.rabbitmq" % "amqp-client" % "2.8.2"
"com.typesafe.akka" % "akka-actor" % "2.0.2"
sbt 0.11.3

No logic changes are done on this fork.
All code changes involve reformatting, and cleaning up <- and => characters.

There were quite a few configuration changes to get the project to compile,pass tests, and package.

To build your own jar 
sbt package
